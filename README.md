# DNA Analysis of Extremophiles

This project aims to analyze the DNA of two extremophile creatures (a thermophile and a tardigrade) using Python and the Biopython library. The analysis includes calculating the GC content of their DNA sequences and finding the alignment score to determine their similarity.

### Analysis Findings

#### 1. GC Content Analysis
- **Thermus thermophilus:** 35.14%
- **Tardigrade (Hypsibius dujardini):** 33.21%

GC content is the percentage of Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) bases in a DNA sequence. High GC content can be associated with the thermal stability of DNA. Our analysis did not show a significant difference, but it provides a good starting point for understanding the role of GC content in organismal adaptation.

#### 2. Sequence Similarity Analysis
- **Alignment Score:** 510.0

The similarity score between the DNA sequences of the two distinct creatures was calculated as 510.0. A higher score indicates a greater degree of similarity. This finding suggests that certain parts of the genes we analyzed are highly similar, which could provide clues about the evolutionary relationships between the two species.

### What I Learned
During this project, I learned the fundamentals of the Biopython library (Entrez, SeqIO, and Align modules) and how to perform basic bioinformatics analysis. I also gained practical experience in important software development practices such as data validation, debugging, and improving code readability.
